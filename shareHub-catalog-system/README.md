## Application

The design of this application is a catalog of items that users of the application can lend to each other. The design builds off the previous project where you built an application that imports data on books and provides the ability to search on that data. Instead of reading the data in from a hard-coded array, you'll read the data in from text files. The dataset has been expanded to include movies and tools, and is in multiple files.


## Running the project

The project provides a basic menu interface to retrieve and print data. Option 1 gives you the ability to print the entire catalog, or just a particular user's catalog items. Option 2 has the search functions of the application. You can search by name, creator, and year.
